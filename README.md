In this detailed Power BI project, an insightful customer churn analysis is conducted for a specific company, revealing critical patterns and trends in customer attrition. Through a comprehensive dashboard, the project visually represents various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to understand demographic, behavioral, and operational drivers behind customer churn.

Key aspects of the analysis include:

Age Demographics: Identification of age groups that exhibit higher churn rates, allowing targeted marketing strategies and retention efforts.
Churn Reasons: Exploration of predominant reasons why customers discontinue services, whether due to pricing, service dissatisfaction, or competitive offers.
Trend Analysis: Monthly and yearly trends in churn rates, providing a temporal view of churn patterns to pinpoint specific periods of increased attrition.
Customer Segmentation: Utilization of segmentation techniques to categorize customers based on their risk of churning, which aids in customized intervention strategies.
Predictive Insights: Development of a predictive model integrated within Power BI to forecast potential churn rates and identify at-risk customers in advance.
Interactive charts and graphs enhance the user experience, enabling stakeholders to drill down into specific data points for deeper analysis. This project not only highlights the current state of customer retention but also provides actionable insights, helping the company to strategize effectively to reduce future churn.
